# PRODIGY_CS_02
This Python-based image encryption tool provides a simple yet effective method for securing images through pixel manipulation, including operations like pixel value swapping and basic mathematical transformations. Users can easily encrypt and decrypt images, rendering them unrecognizable until decrypted back to their original form. The tool supports user-defined operations, allowing for customization in the encryption process, and is compatible with common image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and BMP. Ideal for educational purposes or lightweight image security, this tool demonstrates key concepts in image processing and encryption in a user-friendly manner.
